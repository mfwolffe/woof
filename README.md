The goals of this project were/(are) as follows:
1. Be able to see moby on one of my inactive shells/monitors
1. Practice writing more robust bash scripts
1. More involved bash string manipulation
1. Start to think about how to write scripts that are device/lang agnostic 

In the long term I would like to rewrite this as a C++ program and package it somewhere.
